    <h2>I'm just glad you exist...!!</h2>
    <p class="quote-text">
     When I say I miss you, I don't mean it in some sad<br>
     miserable way, but in a way that honors that connection we had. <br>
     Not in some regretful way, or not even in some way that says <br>
     I wanna see you again, but I just truly miss you. <br><br>
     
     This isn't coming from a negative place, <br>
     and you aren't the only thing in my mind anymore, <br>
     But there are moments which I steal away and think, wow... <br>
     You would have loved to see these. <br><br>

     <i>This isn't a: I wanna be friends again... <br>
      Or even a: I wanna you in my life again... <br>
      Because I know that we both know deep in our hearts... <br>
      That we aren't meant to be, and that's okay. <br><br></i>

     And as tragic our story was, <br>
     I hope you know that, every memory of us has infinite value to me, <br>
     and couldn't be replaced for the world. <br>
     I will love and cherish every single experience we had, but also <br>
     honor that memory, by moving forward with acceptance. <br><br>

     I know there's an infinite amount of words that have gone unsaid, <br>
     but I know that no words could say more <br>
     that the silence between us. <br><br>

     That being said, <br>
     <strong><i>I'm just so glad you exist.</i></strong>
